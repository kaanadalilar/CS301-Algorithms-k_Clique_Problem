<h1 align="center"> k-Clique Problem </h1>

Definition: Clique is a problem in graph theory that checks whether there is a group of vertices in an
undirected graph in which they are all connected to one another. In other words, it asks if there is
a subgraph of size k (where k is an input) that all the vertices are connected to every other vertex
in that subgraph. So basically it aims to check whether there is a clique of a given size and if
there is, to find it.

This repository provides a detailed explanation of the k-Clique problem.
In this repository, one can find;
-- driver code for brute force and heuristic algorithms
-- detailed explanations of both of the algorithms
-- experimental analysis report of perfomance and quality testing
